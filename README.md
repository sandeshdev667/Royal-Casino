# ROYAL CASINO: A  CASINO EXPERIENCE


## Description
**Royal Casino** is a high-fidelity, web-based slot machine simulation designed to provide an immersive casino experience through a modern Python tech stack. It focuses on three core pillars: mathematical integrity through a weighted randomization engine, persistent data management via local file storage, and a responsive, high-end user interface powered by Streamlit and custom CSS.

The primary objective of this software is to simulate the psychological and mechanical aspects of a real slot machine. Unlike basic random-number generators, Royal Slots utilizes a deterministic "House Edge" system that allows for precise control over win probabilities. This ensures that the game remains balanced while providing the user with the visual excitement of sequential reel stops and dynamic feedback animations.
